# Swatch Clock Macro 
For when you feel the need to know the current Internet Time, now available with ease, in your minecraft client. 
## Huh?! Internet Time?! What's that?

Basically, Swatch Internet Time is the entire timezone system disappearing completely, and instead, a day is replaced with 1000 ".beats". So, one .beat is equivalent to 1 Minute 26.4 Seconds.
Pretty neat, since Internet Time is the same everywhere, which means you don't need to worry about timezones anymore... probably.
## Ok, got it. How do I use it (Internet Time)?
Simple! All you need is either Fabric or Forge and JS Macros. After you start the game, press "K" on your keyboard, go to "Events" tab, change the InteractBlock (or whatever is there, near the filename to the left) to "Tick", press on "Edit", paste the code you copied aaand you're good to go!
